# In-Class Assignment: Polymorphism with Animal Sounds

## Objective

Extend the Animal Sound Simulation program by adding polymorphism to handle an array of different animals. You will create a method that takes an array of animals and prints the sounds they make.

## Starter Code

You should already have the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` classes from the previous assignment.

## Instructions

1\. **Create a Method**: Define a method named `PrintAnimalSounds` in the `Program` class. It should take an array of `Animal` objects as a parameter:

2\. **Modify Main Method**: Update the main method to create an array of `Animal` objects containing instances of `Dog` and `Cat`, then call `PrintAnimalSounds` with this array:

3\. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the code. Verify that the program correctly prints the sounds for each animal in the array.
