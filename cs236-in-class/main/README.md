# Assignment: Animal Sound Simulation

## Objective

In this assignment, you will be creating a simple program to simulate the sounds made by different animals. You will
practice using abstract classes and inheritance in C#.

## Instructions

1\. **Create an Abstract Class**: Define an abstract class named `Animal`. It should include an abstract method named
`MakeSound` that returns a string representing the sound the animal makes.

2\. **Implement Dog Class**: Create a class named `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class. Override the `MakeSound`
method to return the string `"Woof!"`.

3\. **Implement Cat Class**: Create a class named `Cat` that inherits from the `Animal` class. Override the `MakeSound`
method to return the string `"Meow!"`.

4\. **Compile and Run**: Compile your code and run the provided main method. Verify that the program outputs the correct
sounds for both the dog and the cat.
